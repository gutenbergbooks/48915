<p class='c008'>The curiosity of the scientific world has for
a long time been justly excited by the fossil
remains of a non-descript animal, which have
been found in North America and Siberia, but
generally in so mutilated a condition as to give
but very imperfect ideas either of the size or kind
of animal to which they must have belonged.
The first account of them which we can find, is
in the fifth volume of Jones’s Philosophical
Transactions abridged, part second, page 159,
in an extract of a letter from Dr. Mather to
Dr. Woodward, dated Boston, Nov. 17, 1712;
in which the Doctor gives an account of a large
work in manuscript, intitled the <i>Biblia Americana</i>.
<i>This work Dr. Mather recommends to the
patronage of some Mecænas, to promote the
publication of. As a specimen of it he transcribes
a passage out of it, being a note on that passage
in Genesis, chap. </i>vi.<i> verse </i>4<i>, relating to giants;
and confirms the opinion of there having been in
the antediluvian world men of a very large and
prodigious stature, by the bones and teeth of
some large animals found lately in Albany in
New England, which, for some reasons, he
thinks to be human; particularly a tooth brought
from the place where it was found to New York
in </i>1705<i>, being a very large grinder, weighing
four pounds and three quarters; with a bone
supposed to be a thigh-bone, seventeen feet
long. He also mentions another tooth, broad
and flat like a fore-tooth, four fingers broad;
the bones crumble to pieces in the air after they
are dug up; they were found near a place called
</i>Cluverack<i>, about thirty miles on this side Albany.
He then gives the description of one which he
resembles to the eye-tooth of a man: He says
it has four prongs or roots, flat and something
worn on the top; it was six inches high, wanting
one-eighth as it stood upright on the root, and
almost thirteen inches in circumference; it
weighed two pounds four ounces Troy weight.
There was another near a pound heavier, found
under the bank of Hudson’s River, about fifty
leagues from the sea, a great way beneath the
surface of the earth, where the ground is of a
different colour and substance from the other
ground, for seventy-five feet long, which they
suppose to be from the rotting of the body, to
which these bones and teeth did, as he supposes,
once belong. It were to be wished he had given
an exact figure of these bones and teeth.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This account is only worth preserving, as it
fixes the time at which these extraordinary
remains of antiquity were first discovered in
America, previous to their being found in Siberia.
The supposition that they were the bones of a
giant was scarcely less probable than that they
should have belonged to a quadruped of which
not the smallest vestige could be traced.—Prepossessed,
therefore, with the certainty of
their being human bones, a calculation was
made of the height of the supposed giant, very
probably from a broken piece of thigh-bone, and
a length of seventeen feet was calculated in
proportion to the thickness of that which was
subject to their examination; for take either
half of these thigh-bones, and nothing can more
resemble that of the human leg, until the whole
is seen together, when, from its thickness, it is
evidently that of a quadruped, the human thigh
being very long and slender. The seventy-five
feet of black earth, which they calculated to be
the length of a man whose thigh-bone was
supposed seventeen feet, could have been nothing
but a small morass divested of its water; and
hence the decayed state of the bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears that about the year 1740, great
numbers of bones, of a similar kind, were found
in Kentucky on the Ohio; but they were
collected with such eagerness, and forwarded
to Europe so hastily, that it shortly became
impossible to distinguish one set of bones from
another, so as to ascertain their number, proportion,
and kind; parts of the same animal
having been scattered over England, France,
and Germany, and there compared with similar
ones from Siberia. Buffon<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> speaking of one of
these thigh-bones brought from the Ohio by the
way of Canada, which he describes as being the
tenth of an inch shorter than one from Siberia,
and yet an inch thicker, says; “This disproportion
is so great as hitherto to deceive me with
respect to this bone, though it otherwise resembles,
both in the external figure and internal
structure, the femur of the elephant (he should
have said, the femur found in Siberia), mentioned
under the number <span class='fss'>DCDLXXXVII</span>. The
difference in thickness, which appeared excessive,
seemed sufficient to attribute this bone to
another animal which must have been larger
than the elephant; but as no such animal is
known, recourse must be had to the pretended
<span class='fss'>MAMMOTH</span>, a fabulous animal supposed to inhabit
the regions of the north, where are frequently
found bones, teeth, and tusks of the
elephant.” Here again the word elephant is
improperly introduced; Messrs. Buffon and
Daubenton having conceived an idea that all the
Siberian and some of the American bones belonged
unquestionably to elephants, render their
observations almost unintelligible, from the confident
use of the term elephant in cases where it
was at least doubtful, especially as it is now
evident, that the same animal was native in the
north of both countries; with one probable
difference, that the bones of the American animal
are comparatively thicker than the Siberian;
and with this striking difference between them
both and the elephant, that the thigh-bones of
the latter are round as well as slender, whereas
those of the Mammoth are much flattened, so
as to stand obliquely in the animal. After reciting
the account given by Mr. Fabry, who
states the place and manner in which Mr. le
Baron de Longueuil, Mr. de Bienville, and Mr.
de Lignery (lieutenant in Canada), found some
of these bones and teeth on the Ohio in 1740,
he proceeds; “Mr. du Hamel, of the Royal
Academy of Sciences, informs us that Mr. de
Longueuil had likewise brought, in 1740, some
very large grinders found in Canada, and perhaps
with the tusk and femur which I shall
mention. These teeth have no characters in
common with those of the elephant, but greatly
resemble the teeth of the hippopotamus, so that
there is reason to believe they may be part of
that animal; for it can never be supposed that
these teeth could have been taken from the same
head with the tusks, or that it could have made
part of the same skeleton with the femur above-mentioned:
In supposing this, it would be necessary
to suppose an <span class='fss'>UNKNOWN ANIMAL</span>, which
had tusks similar to those of the elephant, and
grinders resembling those of the hippopotamus.
(<i>Voyez les Memoires de l’Academie Royale des
Sciences, Année 1762</i>).”</p>

</div>
<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c008'>Here M. de Buffon, however unwillingly, has
drawn a true picture of the Mammoth, with
some little variation, inasmuch as the tusks do
resemble those of the elephant, except in having
a greater curve and spiral twist, and as the teeth
do resemble those of the hippopotamus, except
that in the latter there are never more than three
prongs, or blunt-pointed protuberances, on the
grinding surface; whereas in this animal the
large teeth have five and six, and the small teeth
three and four prongs, very differently arranged
from those of the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>The elephant, which is a graminivorous animal,
is armed with tusks, more properly called
by the French <i>defences</i>; but to me it appears
nothing inconsistent with the nature of a carnivorous
animal that it should be furnished with a
similar weapon of offence and defence, and indeed
from their form somewhat better calculated
to answer those objects; therefore the number
of instances in which these tusks and those carnivorous
teeth were found with bones resembling
the bones of the elephant, though larger,
should have been taken as the strongest presumption
that they were the fragments of one
animal, which, from its fossil remains (accompanied
with the most terrific and fabulous accounts),
has been distinguished, both in Russia
and America, by the name of <span class='sc'>Mammoth</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Collinson, Member of the Royal Society,
in a letter on this subject to M. Buffon<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, after
describing the situation of the salt lick on the
Ohio, where an amazing number of bones of the
elephant, as he imagined them to be, were
found, together with teeth totally unlike those
of the elephant, concludes thus: “But the large
teeth which I send you, Sir, were found with
those tusks or defences; others yet larger than
these shew, nay demonstrate, that they did not
belong to elephants. How shall we reconcile
this paradox? May we not suppose that there
existed formerly a large animal with the tusks
of the elephant and the grinders of the hippopotamus?
For these large grinders are very different
from those of the elephant. Mr. Croghan
thinks, from the great number of this kind of
teeth, that is, the tusks and grinders which he
saw in that place, that there had been at least
thirty of these animals; yet the elephant never
was known in America, and probably could not
have been carried there from Asia: the impossibility
that they could have lived there, owing
to the severity of the winters, and where, notwithstanding
such a quantity of their bones is
found, is a paradox which we leave to your eminent
wisdom to solve.” This determination
M. Buffon gives us in the following terms, although
in direct contradiction to those passages
in which he labours to prove that the bones
found in Siberia and America were bones of the
elephant: “Thus every thing leads us to believe
that this ancient species, which must be
regarded as the first and largest of terrestrial
animals, has not existed since the earliest times,
and is totally unknown to us; for an animal
whose species was larger than that of the elephant,
could hide itself in no part of the earth
so as to remain unknown; besides, it is evident
from the form of these teeth alone, from their
enamel and the disposition of their roots, that
they bear no resemblance to the <i>cachelots</i>, or
other cetaceous animals, and that they really
belonged to a terrestrial animal whose species
approached that of the hippopotamus more
than any other.”</p>

</div>
<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c008'>The world is now in possession of two undisputed
skeletons of this animal, found in such
situations as leave no room for conjecture; each
skeleton being dug up in a separate place, without
any intermixture of foreign bones, and each
bone exactly adapted to its corresponding points
of articulation. One of these skeletons is erected
as a permanent establishment at the Museum,
Philadelphia; the other I have brought with me,
with an intention to travel through Europe, beginning
with the metropolis of England.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall here give a short account of the place
and manner of finding these.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the spring of 1801, having heard that in
the fall of 1799 many bones of this animal had
been found in the state of New York, in the
vicinity of Newburgh, which is situated on the
Hudson or North River, about sixty-seven miles
from the capital, my father, C. W. Peale, immediately
proceeded to the spot, and through the
politeness of Dr. Graham, who lived in the
neighbourhood, and had been present when most
of the bones were dug up, received every information
with respect to what had been done, and
the most probable means of future success. The
bones that had been found were then in the
possession of the farmer who owned the land,
heaped together on the floor of his garret, where
they were occasionally visited by the curious.</p>

<p class='c008'>These my father was fortunate to make a
purchase of, together with the right of digging
up the remainder; and immediately packing
them up, sent them on to Philadelphia: They
consisted of all the neck, most of the vertebræ
of the back, and some of the tail; most of the
ribs, in greater part broken; both scapulæ;
both humeri, with the radii and ulnæ; one femur;
a tibia of one leg, and a fibula of the
other; some large fragments of the head; many
of the fore and hind feet bones; the pelvis somewhat
broken; and a large fragment, five feet
long, of the left tusk, about mid way. He therefore
was in want of some of the back and tail
bones, some of the ribs, the under jaw, one
whole tusk and part of the other, the breast-bone,
one thigh, and a tibia and fibula, and
many of the feet bones. But as the farmer’s
fields were then in grain, the enterprize of
searching for the remainder was postponed for
a short time. Two or three weeks were spent
in mending such bones as were broken, and
arranging the whole; but the deficiencies were
such, that very few of them could be put together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not willing to lose the advantage of the dry
season, when the springs in the morass of course
were low, we proceeded on the arduous enterprize.
In New York every article was provided
which might be necessary in surmounting expected
difficulties; such as a pump, ropes, pullies,
augers, &amp;c.; boards and plank were provided
in the neighbourhood, and timber was in sufficient
plenty on the spot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole of this part of the country abounding
with morasses, it is the custom of the farmers
to assist each other in turns with personal or
specific labour, each man giving a route or frolick
on the occasion, in order to obtain a large
quantity of their contents for manure. Pits are
dug generally twelve feet long and five feet
wide. It was in digging one of these, on the
farm of Mr. Masten, that one of the men, in
thrusting his spade deeper than usual, struck
something which he imagined to be a log of
wood, but on cutting it to ascertain the kind, it
was perceived to be bone: it was quickly cleared
from the surrounding earth, and proved to be
that of the thigh, three feet nine inches in length,
and eighteen inches in circumference in the
smallest part. The search was continued, and
the same evening several other bones were discovered.
The fame of it soon spread through
the neighbourhood, and excited a general interest
in the pursuit; and all were eager, at the
expence of some exertions, to gratify their curiosity,
to see the ruins of an animal so gigantic,
of which few among them had ever heard. For
the two succeeding days upwards of an hundred
men were actively engaged, encouraged by several
gentlemen, chiefly physicians, of the
neighbourhood, and success the most sanguine
attended their labours; but unfortunately the
habits of the men requiring the use of spirits,
it was afforded them in too great profusion, and
they quickly became so impatient and unruly
that they had nearly destroyed the skeleton; in
one or two instances using oxen and chains to
drag them from the clay, the head, hips, and
tusk, were much broken; some parts being
drawn out and others left behind. So great a
quantity of water, from springs in the bottom
of the pit, rose upon the men, that it required
several score of hands to lade it out with all the
buckets they could collect in the neighbourhood.
All their ingenuity was exerted to overcome difficulties
that every hour increased upon their
hands; they even made and sunk a large coffer-dam,
and within it found many valuable small
bones. The fourth day so much water had
risen in the pit, that they had not courage to
attack it again. In this state we found it in
1801.</p>

<p class='c008'>Confident that nothing could be done without
having a perfect command of the water, the
first idea was to drain it by a ditch; but the
necessary distance of perhaps half a mile, presented
a length of labour that appeared immense.
It was therefore resolved to throw the water
into a natural bason about sixty feet distant, the
upper edge of which was about ten feet above
the level of the water. An ingenious millwright
constructed the machinery; and after a
week of close labour, completed a large scaffolding
and a wheel twenty feet diameter, wide enough
for three or four men to walk abreast in: a
rope round this turned a small spindle, which
worked a chain of buckets regulated by a floating
cylinder; the water emptied into a trough
which conveyed it to the bason; a ship’s pump
assisted, and towards the latter part of the
operation, a pair of half barrels in removing the
mud. The second day the water was lowered
so that they began to dig, and in a few hours
were rewarded with several small bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every farmer with his wife and children, for
twenty miles round in every direction, with
waggons, carriages, and horses, flocked to see
the operation; and a swamp always noted for
being the solitary and dismal abode of snakes
and frogs, became the active scene of curiosity
and bustle; the greater part astonished at the
whim of an old man in travelling two hundred
miles from his home, to dig up as a treasure,
at incredible risk, labour, and expence, a pile
of bones, which, although all were astonished
to see, many imagined fit for nothing better
than to rot and serve for manure.</p>

<p class='c008'>For several weeks no exertions were spared,
and those the most unremitting were required
to insure success; bank after bank fell in; the
increase of water was a constant impediment,
the extreme coldness of which benumbed the
workmen: Every day bones and pieces of
bones were found between six and seven feet
deep, but none of the most important ones.
But the greatest obstacle to the search was occasioned
by the shell marle which formed the
lower stratum; this, rendered thin by the springs
at the bottom, and by the weight of the whole
morass, always pressed upwards on the workmen
to a certain height; which, without an
incalculable expence, it was impossible to prevent.
Twenty-five hands, at high wages, were
almost constantly employed at work so uncomfortable
and severe, that nothing but their
anxiety to see the head, and particularly the
under jaw, could have kept up their resolution.
The patience of employer and workmen was at
length exhausted, and the work relinquished
without obtaining those interesting parts without
which it was impossible to form a skeleton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the polite attention of Dr. Galatian,
the next place we directed our attention to was
a morass, eleven miles distant from the former,
belonging to a Captain Joseph Barber, where,
eight years before, four ribs had been found in
digging a pit.  From the description which
was given of their position, and the appearance
of the morass, which was a small one, we began
our operations with all the vigour a certainty of
success could inspire. Almost an entire set of
ribs were found, lying pretty much together,
and very entire; but as none of the back-bones
were found near them, sufficient proof of their
having been scattered, our latitude for search
was extended without limits; therefore, after
working about two weeks, we found nothing
belonging to the head but two rotten tusks (part
of one of them is with the skeleton here), three
or four small grinders, a few vertebræ of the
back and tail, a broken scapula, some toe-bones
and the ribs; these were found between four
and seven feet deep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our next place of search (about twenty miles
west from the Hudson) was a most dismal morass;
the most awful silence reigned throughout
it, and not the smallest breath of air was felt;
every step was taken on rotten timber and the
spreading roots of tall trees, the luxuriant growth
of a few years, half of which were tottering over
our heads. It was almost a dead level, and the
holes dug for the purpose of manure, out of
which a few bones had been taken six or seven
years before, were full of water, and connected
with others containing a vast quantity: so that
to empty one was to empty them all. Machinery
was erected, pumps and buckets were
employed, and a long course of troughs conducted
the water, among the distant roots, to a
fall of a few inches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here alternate success and disappointment
amused and fatigued us for a long while; until
our pockets emptied, our spirits low, our workmen
languid, we were about to quit the morass
with but a small collection, though in good preservation,
of ribs, toe and leg bones, &amp;c. In
the meanwhile the ground was searched in various
directions with long-pointed rods and cross
handles: after some practice we were able to
distinguish by the feel whatever substances we
touched harder than the soil; and by this means,
in a very unexpected direction, struck upon a
large collection of bones, which were dug to and
taken up with every possible care. They proved
to be a humerus, or large bone of the right leg,
with the radius and ulna of the left, the right
scapula, the atlas, and, the great object of our
pursuit, a complete under jaw!</p>

<p class='c008'>After such a variety of labour and length of
fruitless expectation, this success was extremely
grateful to all parties, and the woods echoed
with repeated huzzas. “Gracious God, what
a jaw! how many animals have been crushed
between it!” was the exclamation of all; a fresh
supply of grog went round, and the hearty fellows,
covered with mud, continued the search.
The upper part of the head was found twelve
feet distant, but so extremely rotten that we
could only preserve the teeth and a few fragments.
In its form it exactly resembled the
head found at Masten’s, but as that was much
injured by rough usage, this from its small depth
beneath the surface, had the cranium so rotted
away as only to shew the form around the teeth
and thence extending to the condyles of the
neck; the rotten bone formed a black and greasy
mould above that part which was still entire,
yet so tender as to break to pieces on lifting it
from its bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>This collection was rendered still more complete
by the addition of those formerly taken up,
and presented to us by Drs. Graham and Post.
They were a rib, the sternum, a femur, tibia and
fibula, and a patella or knee-pan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the neighbours, with an eye to the
certain prospect of profit, began to think of
finding a similar treasure in their morasses; and
one actually began his operations, but was
quickly deterred by the rising difficulties, although
he had some reason to hope for success,
eighteen years before, several bones having
been discovered in the same spot, and by a German
physician forwarded to England. We examined
the place, and were of opinion, as the
morass had been since drained, that the remaining
bones must necessarily have decayed in consequence
of their exposure to the air, alternately
wet and dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>We visited every spot in the neighbourhood
where any bones had ever been found, and we
knew of seven within ten miles square; but there
appeared no prospect of success adequate to
the expence and difficulty: So that, after a laborious
campaign of three months, we carefully
packed up, in distinct cases, our venerable relics,
and loading two waggons with them, bade adieu
to the vallies and mountains of Shawangunk.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the laborious task of mending the ribs
and other bones, and putting together the fragments
of the head (of which no other idea could
be formed than appears in the skeleton), it remained
to determine the number and situation
of each kind. The three setts were kept distinct;
out of the two collections which were
most numerous it was intended to form two skeletons,
by still keeping them separate, and filling
up the deficiencies in each by artificial imitations
from the other, and from counterparts in
themselves. For instance, in the first skeleton
the under jaw was formed from this, which is
the only entire one we have ever heard of, although
we have seen considerable fragments of
at least ten different jaws; while on the other
hand, the upper jaw of this animal, which was
found in the extreme of decay, was completed,
so far as it goes, from the more solid fragment
in the former skeleton. Several feet-bones in
this skeleton were made from that; and a few
in that were made from this. In this the right
humerus being real, the imitation for the left one
was made with the utmost certainty; and the
radius and ulna of the left leg being real, those
on the right side followed in course. The collection
of ribs in both cases was pretty entire;
therefore, having discovered from a correspondence
between the number of vertebræ and ribs
in both animals, that there were nineteen pair of
the latter, it was only necessary in four or five
instances where there was not a complete pair,
either to make an artificial counterpart, or to
take the same formed rib from the collection
found at Captain Barber’s. In this manner the
two skeletons were formed, and are in both instances
composed of the appropriate bones of
the animal, or exact imitations from the real
bones in the same animal, or from those of the
same proportion in the other: Nothing is imaginary,
and what we do not unquestionably
know, we leave deficient; which happens in
only two instances, the summit of the head and
the end of the tail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tusk which belongs to the skeleton at
Philadelphia, I have brought with me: in taking
it from the ground it was broken into three
pieces, but they were carefully put together, and
give the entire form, composed of a strong arch
and a spiral twist resembling an ox’s horn, ten
feet six inches in length and twenty-one inches
in circumference. In the Leverian Museum
there is a fossil elephant’s tusk found in England,
about seven feet in length: On making a comparison
between these it will be observed, that
in the Leverian tusk there is not the smallest
twist, and but a gentle curve; whereas in this
animal they are much more crooked in every
respect; the consequence of which is, that as
the cavities for the reception of the tusks lie
more horizontal (from a similar direction between
the teeth and the condyle of the neck),
the tusks are much more elevated, and the ends
pointing backwards. It is the opinion of many,
that these tusks might have been reversed in the
living animal, with their points downwards; but
as we know not the kind of enemy it had to
fear, we judged only by analogy in giving them
the direction of the elephant, especially as we
know of no other carnivorous animal with only
eight grinders and two tusks: Neither the tusk
itself, nor the cavities for the reception of them,
could assist in the determination, as they were
both very straight, and would equally answer
one way as the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one bone less in the neck of this animal
than in the elephant; and we are confident
of having the whole, for two reasons; <i>1st</i>, The
neck-bones were found with the first skeleton all
together, in their natural positions, and the first
bone of the back, with which the sixth vertebræ
of the neck articulated as exactly as it did with
the fifth; and, from the configuration of these
bones, every anatomist knows this could not be
the case was there a bone wanting: This is strong
presumption, had we not the completely satisfactory
proof of finding them all together. And,
<i>2dly</i>, Among the collections of bones which we
have seen, we have never met with a single
bone resembling a seventh vertebra of the neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a more difficult task to determine the
number of dorsal and lumber vertebræ, as those
we dug up ourselves were not only found much
scattered, but several which had been dug up by
the farmer were in the possession of some of the
workmen in the neighbourhood, to the distance
of seven miles round: these we collected with
all possible care, and had the satisfaction to find
they agreed in number with those of the elephant;
still further corroborated by a perfect
agreement between them and the nineteen pair
of ribs, leaving three vertebræ for the loins.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in the head the great distinguishing characters
are to be found. I believe it has been
well enough ascertained that the teeth of this
animal are perfectly carnivorous, as they have
every quality of form and substance that is required:
the roots are not in such a massy body
as the elephant’s, and the teeth are composed of
a bony substance projecting into strong obtuse
points to form the grinding surface, and all this
surface encrusted with a strong coat of enamel;
whereas all graminivorous animals have teeth
whose grinding surface is flat, and composed of
an intermixture of bone and enamel; the enamel
running in laminæ or veins from the surface to
the roots. In carnivorous animals the surface
of the enamel is constantly changing, and is
finally worn off and the teeth rendered useless;
but in graminivorous animals the veins of enamel
always present the same figure, only that in
youth they are regularly protuberant, and in age
regularly worn down by a side-motion of the
under jaw, which all of them have. The jaw
of the Mammoth was incapable of this motion,
as is very evident from the condyloid process,
which is finished with an oblong head inserted
into a transverse groove; and from the teeth,
which are worn, not horizontally, but the lower
front ones on the inside, the upper front ones on
the outside; the lower back ones on the outside
in part, and the upper back ones on the inside
in part; in such a manner that they fit into
each other like the teeth of two saws, and when
shut are immoveable; and hence were certainly
incapable of masticating, like graminivorous animals,
either grass or leaves. These teeth were
supposed by some writers, Buffon, Croghan and
Collinson among others, to have been the teeth
of the hippopotamus, deposited in these places,
together with the remains of elephants, in the
general deluge; but they are very different from
those of the hippopotamus, the largest of which
have only three obtuse points composing the
surface, arranged triangularly; whereas the
smallest teeth in this animal have three rows of
double points arranged parallel to each other,
and the largest ones four and five in the same
manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although a simple comparison between the
teeth of this animal and the elephant be sufficient
to prove that the former is as certainly
of a carnivorous as the latter of a graminivorous
nature, yet the anatomist in examining
further, will find complete satisfaction, from
the internal structure of the jaw, as well as the
position and growth of the teeth. I shall only
observe here, that in the jaw of this animal, like
those of all others of a carnivorous nature, the
roots or fangs are inserted into the mass of bone,
which not only surrounds the roots, but divides
one tooth from the other; whereas in the elephant
the grinders occupy one large and uniform
cavity, from which they are gradually protruded
as they are required for the purpose of
grinding. To those who wish to study this
subject more profoundly, it will be well to read,
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1799, two
learned papers by Mr. Corse and Mr. Home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between the temporal bone of this animal
and that of the elephant there is a considerable
difference in every part; I shall only observe,
that where the socket of the eye in the elephant
appears scooped out of the anterior projection
of the temporal bone, in this animal there is not
the least appearance of such an orbit, but instead
thereof, a great mass of bone.</p>

<p class='c008'>To those who have not seen the originals,
words are inadequate to convey a correct idea
of the difference in form between the jaw of this
animal and that of the elephant. The under
jaw of the elephant terminates in a point, which
in its direction corresponds with the tusks; the
same part in this animal is composed of a large
projection of a foliated appearance like the leaf
of the mallard. And although the lip of the
elephant is large and powerful, in this there appears
the origin of one infinitely more so; perhaps
a long and powerful assistant to the proboscis
which it probably had. There is no positive
proof that it had a proboscis, but from the
shortness of the neck and magnitude of the
tusks, it is reasonable to suppose that it was furnished
with some such contrivance; that part in
which it must have originated is deficient in
both skeletons; and although I have met with
several accounts of the distance between the
orbits of the eyes in fragments of heads, they
were never accompanied with any mention of
such place of insertion for a proboscis.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general form of the under jaw of this
animal is made up of three distinct angles; one
horizontal, on which the jaw rests (when placed
on a table), from the front to the back, where a
small corner appears cut off, whence it rises perpendicularly
to the condyle. The same view
of the elephant’s jaw exhibits very nearly a regular
portion of a circle without any angles. The
arms of this animal’s jaw (composed of the condyloid
and coronoid processes and their bases),
are short as well as flat, adapted to the peculiar
form of the upper jaw, which I shall proceed to
describe; whereas those of the elephant are comparatively
thick, and generally as long as, and
frequently longer than, the body of the jaw itself:
This length is adapted to the great elevation
of the cavity for the condyloid process,
taking the level of the teeth as a base from
which to measure. The angle from the teeth
to the condyles of the neck in the elephant is at
least forty-five degrees, and sometimes more;
but in the Mammoth the same angle does not
exceed ten or fifteen degrees; hence the comparative
disproportion of their jaws with respect
to length and height.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the back of the elephant’s head there is a
very deep cavity for the reception of muscles
from the spines of the back to support the head;
which cavity commences immediately from the
condyle of the neck: The back of this animal’s
head presents a very different outline, for there
is scarcely any appearance of a cavity; and the
whole of the back part of the head is angular,
in contradistinction to that of the elephant,
which is composed of two lobes receding forwards
from the condyle of the neck. I have
been here particular, as in this respect the two
animals are vastly different, and it may lead to
curious speculations concerning the structure of
the unknown parts and the habits of the animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hips were somewhat broken, but the parts
uninjured were sufficient to shew a very different
form from those of the elephant, which are
high in comparison with their breadth; and consequently
the rump of this animal was even more
depressed than the elephant’s, in the manner of
the American bison or buffaloe. In the elephant
the angles from the <i>ossæ tabulæ</i> to the
lateral processes of the ilium, are very great;
whereas in the Mammoth they are almost on a
straight line.</p>

<p class='c008'>From all the drawings of elephants, and from
such of their real ribs as I have seen, I have observed
one universal character; towards their
junction with the cartilage they are broad and
more or less bent sidewise in an undulating form;
whereas those of the Mammoth are very small
in the same place, and in form without any lateral
bend.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Mammoth the spinus processes are
much longer and thicker, in proportion with the
rest of the animal, than they are in the elephant,
whose head is drawn up close to them by the
ligaments attached to the deep cavity in the
back of the head before-mentioned; in the
Mammoth this cavity being situated higher from
the condyle of the neck and attached to much
longer spines, must act with an advantage proportioned
to the magnitude of the head and the
weight of the tusks or defenses. Besides, these
spines are so long, and the form of the ribs such,
that unless we suppose them covered with a superfluous
quantity of flesh, the back of the animal
could not have been <i>round</i> like that of the
elephant, but sharp like that of a hog.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the inhabitant of a cold climate, it is probable
the Mammoth was clothed with hair or
wool, which in most situations was quickly liable
to decay. The only instance of hair being
found with the remains of this animal, occurred
in a morass belonging to Mr. A. Colden, in the
neighbourhood where this skeleton was found.
The hair was coarse, long and brown, a large
mass of it together, and so rotten that, after a
few days exposure to the air, it fell into a
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>The skeleton of the Mammoth<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, merely as
a skeleton, is certainly entitled to some attention;
as the skeleton of a very large and non-descript
animal it becomes more interesting,
to those in particular who are disposed to
think on the subject; whether its extirpation
be attributed to the power of man, the prevalence
of famine, or the violent and sudden irruption
of water. There are many facts to support
this latter opinion, which I confess myself
disposed to adopt.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strahlenberg, in his Historico-Geographical Description, observes, that the Russian name is <i>Mammoth</i>, which is a corruption from <i>Memoth</i>, a word derived from the Arabic <i>Mehemot</i>, signifying the same as the <i>Behemot</i> of Job. This word is applied to any animal of extraordinary size.</p>

<p class='c008'>Orange and Ulster counties in the state of
New York, are situated westward of the Hudson
and northward of West Point; from the
Shawangunk mountain, which is a long ridge
east of the blue mountains, they appear as an
immense plain, bounded on every side by stupendous
mountains, the situation of which certainly
tend to confirm the authenticity of an Indian
tradition, which states them formerly to
have been the boundaries of a great lake; and
it would now be a lake if the high mountains on
each side of the Hudson near West Point were
united, as probably they may have been. It is
a fact that all over the country, the stones,
which in a curious manner are strewed over the
ground, from the largest to the smallest, have
been worn round by long-continued friction, as
if by the agitation of water; more particularly
in the lowest and flat situations, where the stones
are larger, and gradually becoming smaller in
the higher situations. The surface of the country,
though by no means so level as it appears
from the mountains, is formed of single hills,
prominences, or swelling knolls, which have the
appearance of having been caused by the agitation
of water. Many of the cavities between
these knolls are dry, others are in the state of
ponds, but an infinite number contain morasses,
which must originally have been ponds, supplied
by springs which still flow at their bottoms, and
filled, in the course of ages, with a succession of
shellfish and the decay of vegetables; so that at
present they are covered with timber, and have
been so within the memory of man. An old
man, upwards of sixty, informed us, that all the
difference he could remark between these morasses
now and what they were fifty years ago,
was, that then they were generally covered with
firs, and now with beech. This was verified by
the branches and logs of fir which we found in
digging; many pieces of which had been cut by
beavers, the former inhabitants of these places
when in the state of ponds. Scarcely a fir is
now to be found in the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>On digging into these morasses you generally
have to remove from one to two feet of peat or
turf; you then enter on a stratum, from one to
two feet thick, of what the farmers call the yellow
marle, composed of vegetable earth intermixed
with long yellow roots; next the grey marle,
which resembles wet ashes, to the further depth
of two feet; and finally a bed of decayed shells,
which they call shell-marle, the upper surface
of which forms a horizontal line across the morass,
consequently it is thicker in the center
than at the edges; under this, forming the bottom
of the pond or morass, is found gravel and
slate covering a thick stratum of clay. It was
in the white and yellow marle the bones were
generally found; those in the white in the highest
preservation, less so in the grey; and where
an end happened to rise into the yellow stratum
it was proportionally decayed: One cause of
this must have been the accession of air when
the springs in dry seasons were low.</p>

<p class='c008'>The grey marle, in which most of the bones
lay, by analysis was found to contain seventy-three
parts in the hundred of lime: when dried
in the sun it cracks into thin horizontal laminæ,
and becomes extremely light, as hard as baked
clay, and brittle; in this state it burns with a
bright flame for a long while, and instead of
leaving ashes, it remains a strong black coal,
apparently well adapted to the purposes of the
arts.</p>

<p class='c008'>These various strata are the production of a
long succession of ages, and, in my opinion,
have been formed over the bones. In two of
the morasses there was not depth sufficient to
have bemired an animal of such magnitude and
strength; and in the third the bones were lying
near the sloping edge, from which some of them
had already been washed farther in: The animals
have either died or been destroyed generally
over the country, and only in these situations
have been preserved; or they have sought these
cool places to die in; or perhaps both.</p>

<p class='c008'>No calculation can be made of the length of
time necessary to have formed these morasses,
although we are certain that, as in fifty years
past scarcely any change appears, it must have
been proportionally slower in the commencement;
and a period has elapsed in which all accounts
of this animal have dwindled into oblivion,
except a confused Indian tradition.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the neighbourhood of these morasses are
found an infinite number of petrifactions, a few
specimens of which I have brought with me:
they are in strange and unknown figures, and
appear to be generally marine productions, as
various species of coral and sea-urchins were
likewise found among them. Two revolutions
in nature must have contributed to this effect;
one in which the petrifactions were formed by a
copious incrustation of calcareous matter, in a
semifluid state; and a subsequent one, in which
the stones have been broken to pieces, worn into
a round shape, and finally deposited, an hundred
miles from the sea, and many hundreds from
those seas where corals are produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here a question of some importance arises;
could this animal have been destroyed in a deluge,
which must have been sudden and powerful
enough to produce those great effects? And
was the entire race of them thereby rendered extinct?
Certain it is that they are no where to
be found, nor their footsteps traced. Among
the Indians of North America, from nation to
nation, the tradition has spread and prevails,
which relates their former existence and their
sudden extirpation. I shall here give a tradition,
said to be in the very terms of a Shawanee
Indian, as published in Winterbotham’s History
of America, which appears in an embellished
dress from an English pen, but founded on a
real tradition. I have questioned, through their
interpreters, various and distant nations of Indians,
and have known of many others, and all
their accounts agree in the main story, though
they vary in some of the subordinate parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ten thousand moons ago, when nought
but gloomy forests covered this land of the
sleeping sun; long before the pale men, with
thunder and fire at their command, rushed on
the wings of the wind to ruin this garden of
nature; when nought but the untamed wanderers
of the woods, and men as unrestrained as
they, were the lords of the soil; a race of animals
existed, <i>huge as the frowning precipice</i>,
cruel as the bloody panther, swift as the descending
eagle, and terrible as the angel of
night. The pines <i>crashed</i> beneath their feet,
and the lake <i>shrunk</i> when they slaked their
thirst; the forceful javelin in vain was hurled,
and the barbed arrow fell harmless from their
side. Forests were laid waste at a meal; the
groans of expiring animals were every where
heard; and whole villages, inhabited by men,
were destroyed in a moment. The cry of universal
distress extended even to the region of
peace in the west; and the good Spirit interposed
to save the unhappy. The forked lightning
gleamed around, and loudest thunder
rocked the globe! The bolts of heaven were
hurled upon the cruel destroyers alone, and the
mountains echoed with the bellowings of death.
All were killed except one male, the fiercest of
the race, and him even the artillery of the skies
assailed in vain. He ascended the bluest summit
which shades the source of the Monangahela,
and, roaring aloud, bid defiance to every vengeance.
The red lightning scorched the lofty
firs, and rived the knotty oaks, but only glanced
upon the enraged monster. At length, maddened
with fury, he leaped over the waves of
the west at a bound, and this moment reigns the
uncontrouled monarch of the wilderness, in despite
of even Omnipotence itself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The idea of a carnivorous animal, which the
Indians appear to have had of it, corresponds
with the teeth of this; and the name Bull,
which they give to it, might have been derived
from the hornlike appearance of the tusks;
but it is perhaps still more probable, that in the
course of time the ideas of two distinct animals
are confounded; for I have brought with me a
plaister cast from a bone presented last June to
the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, by
Major Brown, of Kentucky: it is unquestionably
a fragment of an animal of the ox kind,
but of a most stupendous magnitude. It consists
of a large portion of one side of the back
part of the head, and part of the other; and
the internal substance or pith, which was covered
by the horn, twenty-one inches in circumference,
and with the horn on it, must have been
at least twenty-four or twenty-five. This bone
was found, in a creek which empties into the
Ohio, some years ago, and by the proprietors
supposed to have been part of the Mammoth.
It is impregnated with ferruginous earth, and in
high preservation; and must have been broken
with violence, but no one knows of any other
portion of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Various bones, generally pieces of the head of
the oxen kind, have been found in all parts of
Europe and in Asia, having the same character
which distinguishes the one from which this cast
was made, in the form and direction of the
horn; it descends backwards, and then rising,
points forwards. There are several specimens
of these in the British Museum, but none so large
as this.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few years since some large bones, of an uncommon
kind, were found in a cave in Virginia,
highly preserved by lying in earth abounding
with nitre. They were sent to the Philosophical
Society, and an account of them published
in the fourth volume of their Transactions: By
permission of the Society, I have made accurate
casts of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hence it appears that four animals of enormous
magnitude have formerly existed in America,
perhaps at the same time, and of natures
very opposite: <i>1st</i>, The Mammoth, carnivorous;
<i>2d</i>, An animal whose graminivorous teeth, larger
than, and different from, those of the elephant,
are sometimes found; <i>3d</i>, The great Indian
bull; and, <i>4th</i>, An animal probably of the sloth
kind, as appears on comparison with the bones
found in Virginia, and a skeleton found in
South America, and preserved in the Museum
at Madrid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Jefferson, on the Mammoth bones, says,
“To whatever animal we ascribe these remains,
it is certain such a one has existed in America,
and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial
beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued
the earth it inhabited and the atmosphere it
breathed, from the imputation of impotence in
the conception and nourishment of animal life
on a large scale; to have stifled in its birth, the
opinion of a writer<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, the most learned too of
all others in the science of animal history, that,
in the new world, ‘<i>La nature vivante est beaucoup
moins agissante, beaucoup moins forte</i>:’
That nature is less active, less energetic on one
side of the globe than she is on the other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was my intention to have closed this account
with Dr. Dunter’s essay, whose accuracy
in the examination, and knowledge in the discrimination
of those few bones which were within
his reach, had already given to his opinion the
weight of unquestionable authority; but as his
paper was somewhat long, and as the facts since
he wrote are more numerous, and subject in the
skeleton which we have, to the examination of
every one; I shall only introduce his concluding
sentence, that, “If this animal was indeed carnivorous,
which I believe cannot be doubted,
though we may as philosophers regret it, as men
we cannot but thank Heaven that its whole generation
is probably extinct.”</p>
